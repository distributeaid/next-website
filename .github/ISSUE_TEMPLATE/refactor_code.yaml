      placeholder: "The Needs Assessment data ingestion could be more efficient.  It currently loads & processes survey results at build time.  Instead, it'd be better to handle that at the API layer and load the processed data from the API into the site.  This decreases site build time and lets us use the processed data on other projects."

        My friends and I worked together on the original text draft... We all agree to assign the copyright to Distribute Aid....
        My colleague at X tech company wrote the underlying code library, and has released it under the MIT open source license (link).
        The content was created by someone long ago, and is in the public domain.
        I found the image through this online service (link), but they require you to pay a $X fee to license it (link).
        I found the code posted on a forum (link), but don't know who the original author is.
