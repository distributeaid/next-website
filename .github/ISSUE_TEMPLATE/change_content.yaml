        My friends and I worked together on the original text draft... We all agree to assign the copyright to Distribute Aid....
        My colleague at X tech company wrote the underlying code library, and has released it under the MIT open source license (link).
        The content was created by someone long ago, and is in the public domain.
        I found the image through this online service (link), but they require you to pay a $X fee to license it (link).
        I found the code posted on a forum (link), but don't know who the original author is.
